## Objective
The project aim to invastigate the application
for the decoder for VGAE.It can be seen that inner product
still have good result when we compare the models for
scalability and complexity.On the other hand,there has
been better applications in order to improve the performance of the decoder using flexiable generative models
and sequence models.
I did not see a significant result in outcomes by using MLP
in the decoder. However, I would like to try this experiment
again on VGAE with sequence models for decoder in order
to get better results.
